> Get yourself running R jobs on the cluster in 10 minutes or so.

Assumptions that I make here:

* you are using R

* your task can be represented as running a function on some inputs
  to create an output (a file based output is OK)

* you are working on a network share and have this mounted on your
  computer

* you know what packages your code depends on

* your package dependencies are all on CRAN, and are all available
  in windows binary form.

If any of these do not apply to you, you'll probably need to read
the full vignette.  In any case the full vignette contains a bunch
more information anyway.

## Install a lot of packages

On windows in particular, this step can be infuriating if something
triggers an upgrade in a package that is being depended on.  If you
end up in a situation where packages simply can't be loaded you may
need to restart R and try installing things from scratch.
Hopefully I can come up with a way of reducing the pain here.


```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github(c(
  "richfitz/ids",
  "dide-tools/context",
  "richfitz/queuer",
  "dide-tools/didewin"))
```

Or:

```r
drat:::add("richfitz")
install.packages("didewin")
```

Or:

```r
install.packages("didewin", repos=c(CRAN="https://cran.rstudio.com",
                                    drat="https://richfitz.github.io/drat"))
```

## Describe your computer so we can find things

On windows if you are using a domain machine, you should need only
to select the cluster you want to use


```r
didewin::didewin_config_global(cluster="fi--didemrchnb")
```

Otherwise, and on any other platform you'll need to provide your username:

```r
didewin::didewin_config_global(credentials="yourusername",
                               cluster="fi--didemrchnb")
```

If you are running Linux we can get both your username and password
from the file you use to mount your network shares (see the main
vignette for details)

```r
didewin::didewin_config_global(credentials="~/.smbcredentials",
                               cluster="fi--didemrchnb")
```

If this is the first time you have run this package, best to try
out the login proceedure with:

```r
didewin::web_login()
```

## Describe your project dependencies so we can recreate that on the cluster

Make a vector of packages that you use in your project:

```r
packages <- c("ape", "MASS")
```

And of files that define functions that you ned to run things:

```r
sources <- "mysources.R"
```

If you had a vector here that would be OK too.  The source file
here is very simple:

```r
make_tree <- function(nspp) {
  message("I am building a tree!")
  ape::rtree(nspp)
}
```

Then save this together to form a "context".

```r
ctx <- context::context_save("contexts", packages=packages, sources=sources)
```

If you have no packages or no sources, use `NULL` or omit them in
the call below (which is the default anyway).

The first argument here, `"contexts"` is the name of a directory
that we will use to hold a lot of information about your jobs.  You
don't need (or particularly want) to know what is in here.

## Build a queue, based on this context.

This will prompt you for your password, as it will try and log in.

It also installs windows versions of all packages within the
`contexts` directory -- both packages required to get this whole
system working and then the packages required for your particular
jobs.


```r
obj <- didewin::queue_didewin(ctx)
```

```
## Loading context 8a89c62653fe70e1a63b735e7833be2c
```

Once you get to this point we're ready to start running things on
the cluster.  Let's fire off a test to make sure that everything works OK:

```r
t <- obj$enqueue(sessionInfo())
```

We can poll the job for a while, which will print a progress bar.
If the job is returned in time, it will return the result of
running the function.  Otherwise it will throw an error.

```r
t$wait(120)
```

```
## R version 3.2.4 Revised (2016-03-16 r70336)
## Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit)
## Running under: Windows Server 2012 R2 x64 (build 9600)

## [2] LC_CTYPE=English_United Kingdom.1252
## [3] LC_MONETARY=English_United Kingdom.1252
## [4] LC_NUMERIC=C
## [5] LC_TIME=English_United Kingdom.1252
##
## attached base packages:
## [1] methods   stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  base
##
## other attached packages:

## [1] R6_2.1.2        context_0.0.8   nlme_3.1-125    grid_3.2.4
## [5] digest_0.6.9    storr_1.0.1     lattice_0.20-33
```

You can use `t$result()` to get the result straight away (throwing
an error if it is not ready) or `t$wait(Inf)` to wait forever.

## Running a single task

This is just using the `enqueue` function as above.  But it also
works with functions defined in files passed in as `sources`; here
the function `make_tree`.

```r
t <- obj$enqueue(make_tree(10))
tree <- t$wait(120)
tree
```

```
##
## Phylogenetic tree with 10 tips and 9 internal nodes.
##
## Tip labels:
## 	t4, t9, t1, t8, t10, t7, ...
##
## Rooted; includes branch lengths.
```

The `t` object has a number of other methods you can use:

```r
t
```

```
## <task>
##   Public:
##     clone: function (deep = FALSE)
##     context_id: function ()
##     db: environment
##     expr: function (locals = FALSE)
##     handle: task_handle
##     id: 15b22b069b6441f89833f032eb7e740a
##     initialize: function (obj, id, check_exists = TRUE)
##     log: function ()
##     result: function (sanitise = FALSE)
##     status: function ()
##     times: function (unit_elapsed = "secs")
##     wait: function (timeout, every = 0.5, progress = TRUE)
```

Get the result from running a task

```r
t$result()
```

```
##
## Phylogenetic tree with 10 tips and 9 internal nodes.
##
## Tip labels:
## 	t4, t9, t1, t8, t10, t7, ...
##
## Rooted; includes branch lengths.
```

Get the status of the task

```r
t$status()
```

```
## [1] "COMPLETE"
```

(might also be "PENDING", "RUNNING" or "ERROR"

Get the original expression:

```r
t$expr()
```

```
## make_tree(10)
```

Find out how long everything took

```r
t$times()
```

```
##                            task_id           submitted             started
## 1 15b22b069b6441f89833f032eb7e740a 2016-05-24 09:03:33 2016-05-24 09:03:57
##              finished  waiting    running      idle
## 1 2016-05-24 09:03:57 23.72405 0.03125095 -21.97055
```

You may see negative numbers for "waiting" as the submitted time is
based on your computer and started/finished are based on the
cluster.

And get the log from running the task

```r
t$log()
```

There is also a bit of DIDE specific logging that happens before
this point; if the job fails inexplicably the answer may be in:

```r
obj$dide_log(t)
```

## Quitting

## Running a bunch of tasks

There are two broad options here;

1. Apply a function to each element of a list, similar to `lapply`
with `queuer::qlapply`
2. Apply a function to each row of a data.frame perhaps using each
column as a different argument with `queuer::enqueue_bulk`

Suppose we want to make a bunch of trees of different sizes.  This
would involve mapping our `make_tree` function over a vector of
sizes:

```r
sizes <- 3:8
grp <- queuer::qlapply(sizes, make_tree, obj, timeout=0)
```

```
## Creating bundle: 'displeasing_frog'
```

```
## saving 6 tasks...
```

```
## submitting 6 tasks...
```

By default, `queuer::qlapply` returns a "task_bundle" with an
automatically generated name.  You can customise the name with the
`name` argument.

Get the startus of all the jobs

```r
grp$status()
```

```
## 7e0c186576974d25949118edd6266fbe c02880bbebf841e6b0903a54b9ca67fb
##                       "COMPLETE"                       "COMPLETE"

##                        "PENDING"                        "PENDING"
```

Wait until they are all complete and get the results

```r
res <- grp$wait(120)
```

The other bulk interface is where you want to run a function over a
combination of parameters.  Use `queuer::enqueue_bulk` here.

```r
pars <- expand.grid(a=letters[1:3], b=runif(2), c=pi, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
pars
```

```
##   a         b        c
## 1 a 0.5728534 3.141593
## 2 b 0.5728534 3.141593
## 3 c 0.5728534 3.141593
## 4 a 0.9082078 3.141593
## 5 b 0.9082078 3.141593
## 6 c 0.9082078 3.141593
```

```r
grp <- queuer::enqueue_bulk(obj, pars, list, do.call=FALSE, timeout=0)
```

```
## Creating bundle: 'crazy_tsetsefly'
```

```
## saving 6 tasks...
```

```
## submitting 6 tasks...
```

By default this runs

* `list(a=pars$a[[1]], b=pars$b[[1]], c=pars$c[[1]])`
* `list(a=pars$a[[2]], b=pars$b[[2]], c=pars$c[[2]])`
* ...
* `list(a=pars$a[[6]], b=pars$b[[6]], c=pars$c[[6]])`


```r
res <- grp$wait(120)
res
```
