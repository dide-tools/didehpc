Parallel computing on a cluster can be more challenging than
running things locally because it's often the first time that you
need to package up code to run elsewhere, and when things go wrong
it's more difficult to get information on why things failed.

Much of the difficulty of getting things running involves working
out what your code depends on, and getting that installed in the
right place on a computer that you can't physically poke at.  The
next set of problems is dealing with the balloning set of files
that end up being created - templates, scripts, output files, etc.

This set of packages
([`didehpc`](https://github.com/dide-tools/didehpc),
[`queuer`](https://github.com/richfitz/queuer) and
[`context`](https://github.com/dide-tools/context), along with a
couple of support packages
([`provisionr`](https://github.com/richfitz/provisionr),
[`buildr`](https://github.com/richfitz/buildr),
[`syncr`](https://github.com/richfitz/syncr),
[`rrq`](https://github.com/richfitz/rrq) and
[`storr`](https://github.com/richfitz/storr)) aims to remove the
pain of getting everything set up, and getting cluster tasks
running, and retrieving your results.

Once everything is set up, running a job on the cluster should be
as straightforward as running things locally.

The documentation here runs through a few of the key concepts, then
walks through setting this all up.  There's also a "quick start"
guide that contains much less discussion.

## Functions

The biggest conceptual move is from thinking about running
**scripts** that generate *files* to running **functions** that
return *objects*.  The reason for this is that gives a well defined
interface to build everything else around.

The problem with scripts is that they might do almost anything.
They depend on untold files and packages which they load wherever.
The produce any number of objects.  That's fine, but it becomes
hard to reason about them to plan deploying them elsewhere, to
capture the outputs appropriately, or to orchestrate looping over a
bunch of paramter values.  If you've found yourself writing a
number of script files changing values with text substitution you
have run into this.

In contrast, functions do (ideally) one thing.  They have a well
defined set of inputs (their arguments) and outputs (their return
value).  We can loop over a range of input values by iterating over
a set of arguments.

This set of packages tends to work best if you let it look after
filenames.  Rather than trying to come up with a naming scheme for
different files as based on parameter values, just return objects
and the packages will arrange for them to be saved and reloaded.

## Filesystems

The DIDE cluster needs everything to be available on a filesystem
that the cluster can read.  Practically this means the filesystems
`//fi--didef2/tmp` or `//fi--san03/homes/username` and the like.
You probably have access to network shares that are specific to a
project, too.  For Windows users these are probably mapped to
drives (`Q:` or `T:` or similar) already, but for other platforms
you will need to do a little extra work to get things set up (see
below).

It is simplest if *everything* that is needed for a project is
present in a single directory that is visible on the cluster.
However, other patterns are possible; see "Running out of place"
towards the bottom of this page.

However for the most of this document I will assume that everything
is in one directory, which is on a network share.

# Getting started

The initial setup will feel like a headache at first, but it should
ultimately take only a few lines.  Once everything is set up, then
the payback is that is the job submission part will become a lot
simpler.

## Installation

Install the packages using [`drat`](https://cran.rstudio.com/package=drat)

```r
# install.package("drat") # if you don't have it already
drat:::add("dide-tools")
install.packages("didehpc")
```

Or, somewhat equivalently

```r
source("https://dide-tools.github.io/didehpc/install")
```

Be sure to run this in a fresh session.

## Configuration

The configuration is handled in a two stage process.  First, some
bits that are machine specific are set using `options` with option
names that are prefixed with `didehpc`.  Then when a queue is
created, further values can be passed along via the `config`
argument that will use the "global" options as a default.

The reason for this separation is that ideally the machine-specific
options will not end up in scripts, because that makes things less
portable (for example, we need to get your username, but your
username is unlikely to work for your collaborators).

Ideally in your ~/.Rprofile file, you will add something like:

```r
options(
  didehpc.username = "rfitzjoh",
  didehpc.home = "~/net/home")
```

and then set only options (such as cluster and cores or template)
that vary with a project.

If you use the "big" cluster, you can add `didehpc.cluster =
"fi--didemrchnb"` here.

At the moment (while things change) it might be simplest to set
things using the `didehpc::didehpc_config_global` function.  The
help file `?didehpc::didehpc_config` outlines the options here.  At
the moment a minimal set of options is your credentials (not needed
on Windows domain machines) and the cluster you wish to use (if you
don't want to use the small cluster).

There are lots of configuration options that can be tweaked, but I
suggest setting things this way *only* for things that will hold
for all projects.

### Credentials

Windows users will not need to provide anything unless they are on
a non-domain machine or they are in the unfortunate situation of
juggling multiple usernames across systems.  Non-domain machines
will need the credentials set as above.

Mac users will need to provide their username here as above.

If you have a Linux system and have configured your smb mounts as
described below, you might as well take advantage of this and set
`credentials = "~/.smbcredentials"` and you will never be prompted
for your password:

```r
options(didehpc.credentials = "~/.smbcredentials")
```

### Seeing the default configuration

To see the configuration that will be run if you don't do anything
(else), run:

```r
didehpc::didehpc_config()
```

```
## <didehpc_config>
##  - cluster: fi--didemrchnb
##  - credentials: ~/.smbcredentials
##  - username: rfitzjoh
##  - build_server: builderhv.dide.ic.ac.uk
##  - template: GeneralNodes
##  - hpctools: FALSE
##  - resource:
##     - parallel: FALSE
##     - count: 1
##     - type: Cores
##  - shares:
##     - home: (local) /home/rich/net/home => //fi--san03/homes/rfitzjoh => Q: (remote)
##     - temp: (local) /home/rich/net/temp => //fi--didef2/tmp => T: (remote)
##  - use_workers: FALSE
##  - use_rrq: FALSE
##  - worker_timeout: 600
##  - rtools: FALSE
##  - r_version: 3.3.2
```

In here you can see the cluster (here, `fi--didemrchnb`),
credentials and username, the job template (`GeneralNodes`),
information about the resources that will be requested (1 core) and
information on filesystem mappings.  There are a few other bits of
information that may be explained further down.  The possible
options are explained further in `?didehpc::didehpc_config`

### Additional shares

If you refer to network shares in your functions, e.g., to refer to
data, you'll need to map these too.  To do that, pass them as the
`shares` argument to `didehpc_config_global`.

To describe each share, use the `didehpc::path_mapping` function
which takes arguments:

* name: a desctiptive name for the share
* `path_local`: the point where the share is mounted on your computer
* `path_remote`: the network path that the share refers to (forward
  slashes are much easier to enter here than backward slashes)
* `drive_remote`: the drive this should be mapped to on the cluster.

So to map your "M drive" to which points at `\\fi--didef2\malaria`
to `M:` on the cluster you can write

```r
share <- didehpc::path_mapping("malaria", "M:", "//fi--didef2/malaria", "M:")
config <- didehpc::didehpc_config(shares = share)
```

If you have more than one share to map, pass them through as a list
(e.g., `didehpc::didehpc_config(shares = list(share1, share2, ...))`).

For most systems we `didehpc` will do a reasonable job of detecting
the shares that you are running on, so this should (hopefully) only
be necessary for detecting additional shares.  The issue there is
that you'll need to use absolute paths to refer to the resources
and that's going to complicate things...

## Contexts

To recreate your work environment on the cluster, we use a package
called `context`.  This package uses the assumption that most
working environments can be recreated by a combination of R
packages and sourcing a set of function definitions.

In order to have the system tell you more about what it is doing,
you can (optionally) run this command.  This can be a bit more
reassuring during long-running setup stages

```r
context::context_log_start()
```

### Root

Every context has a "root"; this is the directory that everything
will be saved in.  Most of the examples in the help use `contexts`
which is fairly self explanatory but it can be any directory.
Generally it will be in the current directory.

```r
root <- "contexts"
```

This directory is going to get large over time and will eventually
need to be deleted.  Eventually I will come up with some tools to
simplify working with these.  In the meantime, treat these as
somewhat disposable.

### Packages

If you list packages as a character vector then all packages will
be installed for you, and they will also be *attached*; this is
what happens when you use the function `library()` So for example
if you need to depend on the `rstan` and `ape` packages you could
write:

```r
ctx <- context::context_save(root, packages = c("rstan", "ape"))
```

Attaching packages is not always what is wanted, especially if you
have packages that clobber functions in base packages (e.g.,
`dplyr`!).  An alternative is to list a set of packages that you
want installed and split them into packages you would like attached
and packages you would only like loaded:

```r
packages <- list(loaded = "geiger", attached = "ape")
ctx <- context::context_save(root, packages = packages)
```

In this case, the packages in the `loaded` section will be
installed (along with their dependencies) and before anything runs,
we will run `loadNamespace` on them to confirm that they are
properly available.  Access functions in this package with the
double-colon operator, like `geiger::fitContinuous`.  However they
will not be attached so will not modify the search path.

In contrast, packages listed in `attached` will be loaded with
`library` so they will be available without qualification (e.g.,
`read.tree` rather than `ape::read.tree`).

### Source files for function definitions

If you define any of your own functions you will need to tell the
cluster about them.  The easiest way to do this is to save them in
a file that contains only function definitions (and does not read
data, etc).

For example, I have a file `mysources.R` with a very simple tree
simulation in it.  Imagine this is some slow function that given an
integer `nspp` after a bunch of calculation yields a tree with
`nspp` tips:

```r
make_tree <- function(nspp) {
  message("I am building a tree!")
  ape::rtree(nspp)
}

combine <- function(a, b, c) {
  sprintf("%s: %2.5f", a, b + c)
}
```

To set this up, we'd write:

```r
ctx <- context::context_save(root, packages = "ape", sources = "mysources.R")
```

```
## [ open:db   ]  rds
```

```
## [ save:id   ]  1beec5e72c2b0c60d45e655b3b9b5e91
```

```
## [ save:name ]  displeasing_frog
```

`sources` can be a character vector, `NULL` or `character(0)` if
you have no sources, or just omit it as above.

### Custom packages

If you depend on packages that are not on CRAN (e.g., your personal
research code) you'll need to tell `context` where to find them
with its `package_sources` argument.

If the packages are on GitHub and public you can pass the github
username/repo pair, in `devtools` style:

```r
context::context_save(...,
  package_sources = provisionr::package_sources(github = "richfitz/kitten"))
```

Like with `devtools` you can use subdirectories, specific commits
or tags in the specification.

If the packages are private, it is simplest to pass the path to
where the package can be found on your computer with the `local`
argument to `package_sources`.

## Creating the queue

Once a context has been created, we can create a queue with it.
This is separate from the actual cluster queue, but will be our
interface to it.  Running this step takes a while because it
installs all the packages that the cluster will need into the
context directory.

```r
obj <- didehpc::queue_didehpc(ctx)
```

```
## Loading context 1beec5e72c2b0c60d45e655b3b9b5e91
```

```
## [ context   ]  1beec5e72c2b0c60d45e655b3b9b5e91
```

```
## [ library   ]  ape
```

```
## [ namespace ]
```

```
## [ source    ]  mysources.R
```

```
## [ provision ]  library at contexts/lib/windows/3.3
```

```
## [ download  ]  package database
```

If the above command does not throw an error, then you have
successfully logged in.  When you run `queue_didehpc` it will
install windows versions of all required packages within the `root`
directory (here, "contexts").  This is necessary even when you are
on windows because the cluster cannot see files that are on your
computer.

`obj` is a weird sort of object called an `R6` class.  It's a bit
like a Python or Java class if you've come from those languages.
The thing you need to know is that the object is like a list and
contains a number of functions that can be run by runing
`obj$functionname()`.  These functions all act by *side effect*;
they interact with a little database stored in the context root
directory or by communicating with the cluster using the web
interface that Wes created.

```r
obj
```

```

For example, to list the tasks that we know about:

```r
obj$task_list()
```

```
##  [1] "0d94ebd914dba0b3a086a2457add526b" "154bfc41d01fe93afba7cbc65f5e282f"

(of course there are no tasks yet because we haven't added any).
As a slightly more interesting example we can see how busy the
cluster is:

```r

(if you're on a ANSI-compatible terminal this will be in glorious
colour).

## Testing that the queue works correctly

Before running a real job, let's test that everything works
correctly by running the `sessionInfo` command on the cluster.
When run locally, `sessionInfo` prints information about the state
of your R session:

```r
sessionInfo()
```

```

To run this on the cluster, we wrap it in `obj$enqueue`.  This
prevents the evaluation of the expression and instead organises it
to be run on the cluster:

```r
t <- obj$enqueue(sessionInfo())
```

We can then poll the cluster for results until it completes:

```r
t$wait(100)
```

(see the next section for more information about this).

The important part to notice here is that the R "Platform" (second
and third line) is Windows Server, as opposed to the host machine
which is running Linux.  In addition note that `ape` is lited under
"other attached packages" and that `context`, as well as some other
packages (`R6` `storr` and `digest` in particular) have been
installed and are loaded (but not attached).  This shows that the
system has set up a working environment like our local one on the
remote machine, and we can evaluate tasks in it!

## Running single jobs

Let's run something more interesting now by running the `make_tree`
function defined in the `mysources.R` file.

As above, jobs are queueed by running:

```r
t <- obj$enqueue(make_tree(10))
```

Like the queue object, `obj`, task objects are R6 objects that can
be used to get information and results back from the task.

```r
t
```

```
## <queuer_task>
##   Public:
##     clone: function (deep = FALSE) 
##     context_id: function () 
##     expr: function (locals = FALSE) 
##     id: 40934f0a0d28ca7385b8eb201b1146b7
##     initialize: function (id, root, check_exists = TRUE) 
##     log: function (parse = TRUE) 
##     result: function (allow_incomplete = FALSE) 
##     root: context_root
##     status: function () 
##     times: function (unit_elapsed = "secs") 
##     wait: function (timeout, time_poll = 0.5, progress = NULL)
```

the task's status

```r
t$status()
```

```
## [1] "PENDING"
```

...which will move from `PENDING` to `RUNNING` to `COMPLETE` or
`ERROR`.  You can get information on submission and running times

```r
t$times()
```

```
##                            task_id           submitted started finished
## 1 40934f0a0d28ca7385b8eb201b1146b7 2017-05-10 14:13:22    <NA>     <NA>
##     waiting running idle
## 1 0.5632026      NA   NA
```

and you can try and get the result of running the task:

```r
t$result()
```

```
## Error: task 40934f0a0d28ca7385b8eb201b1146b7 is unfetchable: PENDING
```

The `wait` function, used above, is like `result` but it will
repeatedly poll for the task to be completed for up to `timeout`
seconds.

```r
t$wait(100)
```

```
## 
## Phylogenetic tree with 10 tips and 9 internal nodes.
## 
## Tip labels:
## 	t8, t7, t4, t9, t6, t10, ...
## 
## Rooted; includes branch lengths.
```

once the task has completed, `t$result()` and `t$wait` are equivalent

```r
t$result()
```

```
## 
## Phylogenetic tree with 10 tips and 9 internal nodes.
## 
## Tip labels:
## 	t8, t7, t4, t9, t6, t10, ...
## 
## Rooted; includes branch lengths.
```

Every task creates a log:

```r
t$log()
```

```

Warning messages and other output will be printed here.  So if you
include `message()`, `cat()` or `print()` calls in your task they
will appear between `start` and `end`.

There is another bit of log that happens before this and contains
information about getting the system started up.  You should only
need to look at this when a job seems to get stuck with status
`PENDING` for ages.

The queue knows which tasks it has created and you can list them:

```r
obj$task_list()
```

```

```

The long identifiers are random and are long enough that collisions
are unlikely.

Notice that the task ran remotely but we never had to indicate
which filename things were written to.  There is a small database
based on [`storr`](https://richfitz.github.com/storr) that holds
all the information within the context root (here, "contexts").
This means you can close down R and later on regenerate the `ctx`
and `obj` objects and recreate the task objects, and re-get your
results.  But at the same time it provides the _illusion_ that the
cluster has passed an object directly back to you.

```r
id <- t$id
id
```

```
## [1] "40934f0a0d28ca7385b8eb201b1146b7"
```

```r
t2 <- obj$task_get(id)
t2$result()
```

```
## 
## Phylogenetic tree with 10 tips and 9 internal nodes.
## 
## Tip labels:
## 	t8, t7, t4, t9, t6, t10, ...
##

```

## Running many jobs

There are two broad options here;

1. Apply a function to each element of a list, similar to `lapply`
with `$lapply`
2. Apply a function to each row of a data.frame perhaps using each
column as a different argument with `$enqueue_bulk`

The second approach is more general and `$lapply` is implemented
using it.

Suppose we want to make a bunch of trees of different sizes.  This
would involve mapping our `make_tree` function over a vector of
sizes:

```r
sizes <- 3:8
grp <- obj$lapply(sizes, make_tree)
```

```
## Creating bundle: 'uncongested_whiteeye'
```

```
## [ bulk      ]  Creating 6 tasks
```

```
## submitting 6 tasks
```

By default, `$qlapply` returns a "task_bundle" with an
automatically generated name.  You can customise the name with the
`name` argument.

In contrast to `lapply` this is not blocking (i.e., submitting
tasks and collecting the results is done asynchronously) but if you
pass a `timeout` argument to `$lapply` then it will poll until the
jobs are done, in the same way as `wait()`, below.

Get the startus of all the jobs

```r
grp$status()
```

```
## 3ee2c8d30c31fa85c79cd44af033baab b55f28bcca450290225b527f78603c6d 
##                       "COMPLETE"                       "COMPLETE" 
## d259f16e58f2bd4db4631a97474767ab e9b5dbf29ee12fe43892b6367bf44050 
##                       "COMPLETE"                       "COMPLETE" 
## 2a114a3a22692539b6f0a22128edb5a3 b5f37eb02f8c2949ebc394c3cf110274 
##                        "RUNNING"                        "PENDING"
```

Wait until they are all complete and get the results

```r
res <- grp$wait(120)
```

The other bulk interface is where you want to run a function over a
combination of parameters.  Use `queuer::enqueue_bulk` here.

```r
pars <- expand.grid(a = letters[1:3], b = runif(2), c = pi,
                    stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
pars
```

```
##   a         b        c
## 1 a 0.6607978 3.141593
## 2 b 0.6607978 3.141593
## 3 c 0.6607978 3.141593
## 4 a 0.6291140 3.141593
## 5 b 0.6291140 3.141593
## 6 c 0.6291140 3.141593
```

Suppose that we have a function that we want to run over this set
of parameters.

```r
combine(pars$a[[1]], pars$b[[1]], pars$c[[1]])
```

```
## [1] "a: 3.80239"
```

```r
grp <- obj$enqueue_bulk(pars, combine, do_call = TRUE)
```

```
## Creating bundle: 'auspicial_bunny'
```

```
## [ bulk      ]  Creating 6 tasks
```

```
## submitting 6 tasks
```

By default this runs

* `combine(a = pars$a[[1]], b = pars$b[[1]], c = pars$c[[1]])`
* `combine(a = pars$a[[2]], b = pars$b[[2]], c = pars$c[[2]])`
* ...
* `combine(a = pars$a[[6]], b = pars$b[[6]], c = pars$c[[6]])`
